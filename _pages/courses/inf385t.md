### Course overview and objectives

This course explores the design and development of practical applications powered by large language models (LLMs), including agentic systems that can plan, take actions, and use tools to complete real-world tasks. The course covers both LLM fundamentals—how LLMs work, their capabilities and limitations—and applied methods for building reliable systems, including prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, orchestration, safety, and evaluation. The course is project-driven: student teams build and iterate on an LLM-based application throughout the term, complemented by guest lectures from founders, investors, and researchers on building and assessing frontier AI systems.

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Design and build a working LLM-powered application from idea to deployed product
2. Apply core techniques—prompting, RAG, orchestration, agentic tool use, and multi-modal integration—to solve real-world problems
3. Evaluate LLM systems for quality, safety, and cost
4. Iterate on a product based on real user feedback
5. Communicate and present an AI product to technical and non-technical audiences

### Course requirements and grading policy

* **Individual assignments (30%)** — Weeks 1–4
  * Week 1: Four one-pagers on AI products
  * Weeks 2–4: Three individual demos built with AI tools

* **Class project (60%)** — Weeks 5–16
  * Teams of 3 students with complementary expertise (e.g., engineering, design, domain knowledge).
  * Grading based on:
    * Lightweight demo day presentation (Week 5)
    * Beta test and demo day (Week 10)
    * Iteration progress and user feedback incorporation (Weeks 11–15)
    * Public demo day (Week 16)

* **Peer review and participation (10%)**
  * Reviewing and voting on classmates' demos (Week 5), beta testing other teams' products (Week 10), and engagement with guest speakers.

* The course will use plus-minus grading, using the following scale:

| Grade | Percentage |
| ----- | ---------- |
| A     | ≥ 93%      |
| A-    | ≥ 90%      |
| B+    | ≥ 87%      |
| B     | ≥ 83%      |
| B-    | ≥ 80%      |
| C+    | ≥ 77%      |
| C     | ≥ 73%      |
| C-    | ≥ 70%      |
| D+    | ≥ 67%      |
| D     | ≥ 63%      |
| D-    | ≥ 60%      |

### Academic integrity and AI tools

This course *requires* you to use AI tools — ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, and whatever else helps you build. Building on the shoulders of AI is a core skill this class teaches.

That said, using AI tools does not remove your responsibility to understand what you submit. You must be able to explain every piece of your work — how it works, why you made the choices you did, and what the tradeoffs are. If your only answer is "the AI told me to do it," that is not your own work.

You are encouraged to discuss ideas with classmates, consult external resources, and use open-source code. However, you must cite any substantial external code or resources you incorporate. For individual assignments, the work you submit must reflect your own understanding. For team projects, all team members are expected to contribute meaningfully and be able to speak to the full scope of the project.

### Notice about students with disabilities

The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Please contact the [Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities](https://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/), 512-471-6259.

### Notice about missed work due to religious holy days

A student who cannot meet an assignment deadline due to the observance of a religious holy day may submit the assignment up to 24 hours late without penalty, if proper notice of the planned absence has been given. Notice must be given at least 14 days prior to the due date. For religious holy days that fall within the first 2 weeks of the semester, notice should be given on the first day of the semester. Notice should be emailed to the instructor and course staff.
