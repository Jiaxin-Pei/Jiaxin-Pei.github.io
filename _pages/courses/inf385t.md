### Course overview and objectives

This course explores the design and development of practical applications powered by large language models (LLMs), including agentic systems that can plan, take actions, and use tools to complete real-world tasks. The course covers both LLM fundamentals—how LLMs work, their capabilities and limitations—and applied methods for building reliable systems, including prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, orchestration, safety, and evaluation. The course is project-driven: student teams build and iterate on an LLM-based application throughout the term, complemented by guest lectures from founders, investors, and researchers on building and assessing frontier AI systems.

### Course requirements and grading policy

* **Assignments, 60%**  
  * These will involve programming projects and write-ups. You will be required to turn in your code.

* **Class project, 40%**  
  * An open-ended project building an LLM-based application. Work with the instructor to find a topic you are interested in.
  * Milestones:
    * An initial presentation and written proposal of your project;
    * Final project presentation.

* The course will use plus-minus grading, using the following scale:

| Grade | Percentage |
| ----- | ---------- |
| A     | ≥ 93%      |
| A-    | ≥ 90%      |
| B+    | ≥ 87%      |
| B     | ≥ 83%      |
| B-    | ≥ 80%      |
| C+    | ≥ 77%      |
| C     | ≥ 73%      |
| C-    | ≥ 70%      |
| D+    | ≥ 67%      |
| D     | ≥ 63%      |
| D-    | ≥ 60%      |

### Extension policy

* **Slip days**: You will have a total of 4 free slip days that you can use throughout the semester. You can choose how many days you want to use and distribute them across assignments. Slip days cannot be used fractionally: submitting an assignment 1 hour late incurs 1 slip day, 25 hours late incurs 2 slip days, etc.
* **Extension permissions**: Beyond the slip days, extensions may *ONLY* be granted on a case-by-case basis due to medical emergency or other extraordinary circumstances. You *MUST* reach out to the instructor to obtain an extension *before the deadline in question*.
* **Late penalty**: If you have used up your free slip days and did not obtain permission for an extension, 10 points (out of 100) will be deducted for lateness, plus an additional 5 points for every 24-hour period beyond 2 that the assignment is late. Resubmissions of assignments are allowed; extension penalty applies for post-deadline resubmissions.

### Academic dishonesty policy

You are encouraged to discuss assignments with classmates. But all coding and written work must be your own. You are not allowed to collaborate with other students directly on code and submit shared code as part of two or more students' submissions, unless this is explicitly allowed as in the case of the final project.

You may consult external resources such as blog posts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and GitHub repositories. However, your use of such resources must be limited in the same way as discussions with classmates: you can look at these to get ideas, but you should not take external code and submit it as part of your assignment.

Be sure you respect these policies when posting on the discussion board. Asking clarifying questions and addressing possible bugs in the provided code are fair game, but do not discuss solutions in a substantive way that might spoil them for others. When in doubt, do not post large amounts of source code publicly.

Students who violate these policies may receive a failing grade on the assignment in question or for the course overall, depending on the instructor's judgment and the severity of the infraction.

### Policy on ChatGPT, Copilot, and other AI assistants

We *require* you to use ChatGPT and related tools to understand concepts and as assistants with programming assignments. Building on the shoulder of GenAI tools is a key focus of this class. 

### Notice about students with disabilities

The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Please contact the [Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities](https://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/), 512-471-6259.

### Notice about missed work due to religious holy days

A student who cannot meet an assignment deadline due to the observance of a religious holy day may submit the assignment up to 24 hours late without penalty, if proper notice of the planned absence has been given. Notice must be given at least 14 days prior to the due date. For religious holy days that fall within the first 2 weeks of the semester, notice should be given on the first day of the semester. Notice should be emailed to the instructor and course staff.
