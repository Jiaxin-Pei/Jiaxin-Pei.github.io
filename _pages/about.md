I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) working with [Alex 'Sandy' Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/), [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) and [Erik Brynjolfsson](https://www.brynjolfsson.com). I am affiliated with the [Stanford Digital Economy Lab](https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu) and the [Stanford NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu). I obtained my PhD from School of Information at the University of Michigan advised by [David Jurgens](http://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/). I also worked with [Jun Li](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jun-li) at Ross School of Business. 
Outside of academia, I have interned at Bloomberg, Snapchat, Nokia Bell Labs, and Tencent.

I will join the [School of Information at UT-Austin](https://ischool.utexas.edu) as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2026 and will start a new lab on Human-Centered AI Systems. I will be hiring PhD, Master's, undergraduate, and visiting students to work on LLM and HCI. Please check out [my advising philosophy](https://jiaxin-pei.github.io/working-with-me/) and fill out this [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdexPPwufb_k5d1Vl3Y8hlxBQ6wq8SVO1-XJtLYnr614N8R3g/viewform?usp=dialog).


## Research Interests
My research focuses on Large Language Models, Human-Computer Interaction and Computational Social Science. I am currently interested in the following research directions:

**1. Human-AI Interaction:** Develop new interfaces and systems for human users to better interact with AI models; build more interactive, collaborative and trustworthy AI agents; Create new benchmarks and pipeline for AI system evaluation.

**2. Digital Infrastructure for AI Agents:** Build new standards and protocals for the future society with AI Agents. 

**3. Data Pipeline for LLM Training and Evaluation:** Build effective data collection and annotation pipeline to better train and evaluate LLMs. 

**3. Collective Intelligence Systems:** Build new systems that help groups and communities to better collaborate and make decisions. 

**4. Computational Social Science:** Understand the impact of AI and technology on individuals, community and society. 


## Awards & Recognition
