## General Advising Philosophy
Whether you are a PhD student, master's student, or an undergraduate, once I decide to work with you on a project, I consider it an **adventure** where we can explore something interesting together. I understand that people might be motivated by things like money, recommendation letters, graduation requirements, etc. I'm totally fine with that. However, the most important thing for me is whether we enjoy the time we spend together on a project and whether we can create something that both of us are proud of. I will do my best to make this adventure exciting, and I also hope that you come with similar values.

## PhD Students
A PhD is a long (usually 4-6 years) commitment, so it is a long **adventure**. The ultimate goal of PhD training is to help students become principal investigators (PIs). I know PI is sometimes only viewed as a role in academia. However, to me, it doesn't matter whether you want to go into industry or academia after graduation. It's all about helping you develop deep interests in one or several directions and learning the skills to explore them on your own, so that you can lead your future students, team members, or just yourself to create new knowledge and tools for the things you are interested in. Currently, I'm most excited about training advanced user-centric AI agents and building cool HCI systems that can help make our lives easier and better. If you are interested in training models, UT-Austin currently has 600 H200 GPUs (with more on the way), and we are very fortunate to have a large number of GPU hours to do some cool things (thanks to the generous support from [TACC](https://tacc.utexas.edu)). If you are interested in building HCI systems, I have extensive experience in building systems that are actively used by companies, government, and the general public (for example, [POTATO](https://github.com/davidjurgens/potato?tab=readme-ov-file) and [Deliberation.io](https://deliberation.io)). Email me if you want to do some cool things together!

## Master's and Undergraduate Students
I really enjoy working with master's students and undergraduate students. Usually, I prefer to work on a very specific and well-scoped project, as you might not have much research experience yet. Solid coding and analytical skills are required.
